This is my *Project 2* for the *Oasis Infobyte Python Programming Internship (November Batch)*.

The BMI Calculator helps users calculate their *Body Mass Index* and know their *health category* based on height and weight inputs.

## 🧠 Features
- Takes user height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms)
- Calculates BMI using the formula:
--BMI =weight/(height**2)
- Displays health status:
- Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
- Normal (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25)
- Overweight (25 ≤ BMI < 30)
- Obese (BMI ≥ 30)
